You need a "credentials.credentials" file in the same folder as the Jar. This is of course going to change. The format for the above file is as follows: 

"Account Name", "server address", port, "use SSL", "username", "password"

For example: 

"JavaPushMail", "mail.server.com", 993, "true", "username", "password"
